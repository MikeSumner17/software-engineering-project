1. Members need to be assigned unique barcodes
  -remove barcode option from addmember.php
  -remove barcode option from sendmember.php
  -adjust database members table, column barcode, to assign a unique numeric varchar(100) non-nullable identifying number
Solution 1: 
Looks like we can use the AUTO_INCREMENT feature and create a starting point of 1111, 
this will likely only work on the id column, so we'll have to...
  -remove and replace barcode references to id references 
  OR
  -rename id to barcode (possible? try this first because it would be easier)

 2. Adding Members Radio options currently arent required, and fill the membershiplevel field with null
  -figure a way to make at least *one* of the radio options required
  -change database member table, column membershiplevel type to varchar(100) non-nullable
  -ensure that the data base reflects selected options
  
3. Add scripts for errors and redirect properly (create account)
